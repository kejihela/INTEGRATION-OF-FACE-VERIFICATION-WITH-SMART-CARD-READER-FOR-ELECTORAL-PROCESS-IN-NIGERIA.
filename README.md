# INTEGRATION-OF-FACE-VERIFICATION-WITH-SMART-CARD-READER-FOR-ELECTORAL-PROCESS-IN-NIGERIA.
Using some fascinating methods, a research was carried out to improve the performance of the existing face verification algorithms.


The selection of a good leader plays a major role in the development and sustainability of a
country economic growth. The means by which these leaders are selected should be free from
various malpractices by enabling a reliable system that ensure accountability and transparent
electoral process. The earliest system adopted posed great threat to the security of life and
properties of the voters which led to the introduction of the secret ballot system in which
accreditation and authentication are done by means of sighting. While this system was
considered as a good replacement of the open ballot system yet it gives room for various
electoral malpractices. This brought about the introduction of electronic voting by the use of
smart card reader for accreditation and authentication, but this system failure to authenticate
eligible voters in several cases lead to the proposal for the integration of computer vision
technology with the existing system. The underlying demographics of datasets used to train
face verification models are frequently insufficient to account for the huge range of facial traits
found in people all over the world. To mitigate these limitations, we design a model based on
the popular VGG architecture and a dataset rich enough to represent the geographical diversity
of people across the world and introduced the just published FaVCI2D dataset for evaluation of
the model. which was then deployed for authentication of voters for use in the electoral process
using an Android application system. The bulk of reported biases are attributable to the use of
demographically unbalanced training data in the creation of face recognition algorithms. We
were able to improve performance of face verification model using dataset of suitable technical
design as stated by (Popescu et al, 2021).
